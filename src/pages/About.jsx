        EcoOcean is a crowdfunding organisation that connects local projects on
        the ground requiring funding, to those individuals or organisations that
        are able to donate to a cause of their interest and concern. If you'd
        like to register your local project, please do so and this will be
        assessed internally prior to being added to this website. EcoOcean
        primarily responds to significant environmental disasters at risk of
        affecting wildlife that require immediate support. Please browse through
        this website and make a difference to a local wildlife or animal
        population today!
