      <p>
        EcoOcean is a crowdfunding organisation that connects local projects on
        the ground requiring funding, to those individuals or organisations that
        are able to donate to a cause of their interest and concern. If you'd
        like to register your local project, please do so and this will be
        assessed internally prior to being added to this website.
      </p>
      <p>
        EcoOcean primarily responds to significant environmental disasters at
        risk of affecting wildlife that require immediate support. Please browse
        through this website and make a difference to a local wildlife or animal
        population today!
